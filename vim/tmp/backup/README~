Expresso Server
****************
Server is configured in the config/expresso.conf file.
User accounts are configured in the specified account file, by default config/accounts.
For testing purposes, account information is stored with plaintext passwords. The account file lines are organized as such:
<username>:<password>:<directory>
If directory is blank, the server's configured default directory is used instead.

****************
Client is used to connect to a currently running/listening Expresso Server instance. Its usage is similar to scp:
./expresso_client zac@192.168.0.120:file.data /tmp/
More detailed options can be found by running ./expresso_client -h
